Let's take a dive into the Swarm network's performance metrics for September. The  details below offer a window into individual node earnings, win value statistics, and the geographical node distribution. By juxtaposing September's metrics with August's data, we can explore the network's growth patterns.

### Data Considerations: 

All data in this report is based on nodes which have won the redistribution game at least once per month, nodes which have not won were not included.

### Network Total Monthly Rewards

This metric is the total monthly rewards paid out across the entire network.

| Month  | Total Rewards (BZZ)  |
| ------ | -------------- |
| April  | 20503    |
| May    | 21423   |
| June   | 26655     |
| July   | 34839    |
| August | 135927     |
| **September** | **147825**|

In September, the network's total monthly rewards climbed to **147,825 BZZ**, marking an uptick from August's 135,927 BZZ. 

### Single Node Monthly Average Earnings
This metric is the average total winnings per staking node per month.

| Month  | Average Earnings (BZZ)  |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| April  | 14.30            |
| May    | 14.85            |

For September, nodes witnessed a marginal rise in their average earnings, reaching **69.56 BZZ**, a hair more than last month's average of 68.20 BZZ.


### Monthly Median Win Values
This metric is the median win amount for each win event.


| Month  | Median Win Value (BZZ)  |

September's median win values ticked up slightly to **44.62 BZZ**, generally in line with the 43.97 BZZ median value in August. 


### Monthly Average Win Values
This metric is the average win amount for each win event.

| Month  | Average Win Value (BZZ)  |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| April  | 7.60               |
| May    | 8.29               |

The average win values for September escalated to **46.52 BZZ**, a significant increase from August's 41.45 BZZ. 


### Number of Staking Nodes by Month
This is determined by the number of unique staking nodes each month which have won at least once in that month (as noted above, it does not include nodes which did not win in that month).

| Month  | Number of Nodes |
| ------ | --------------- |
| April  | 1434            |
| May    | 1443            |
| June   | 1415            |

September saw the staking node count swell to **2,125**, up from August's 1,993. 


### Total Active Nodes by Month
This metric is defined as the total number of unique nodes (both staking and non-staking nodes) which are active on the Swarm network each month.

| Month  | Number of Nodes |
| ------ | --------------- |
| April  | 2016            |
| May    | 4352            |
