Are you looking to incorporate decentralised storage solutions into your project? If yes, then the [Swarm Association Grants Program](https://www.ethswarm.org/grants) is here to support you. With financial support, the program aims to onboard promising projects and expand the [Swarm Association's](https://www.ethswarm.org/)
ecosystem. This blog will walk you through the process of applying for a grant.


## **Eligibility and Application**

Before diving into the application process, let's go over the eligibility criteria:

- **Project code has to be open-source: closed-source code is not eligible**
- **Swarm Association prioritizes grant proposals that are aligned with the topic of the current wave, but also accepts proposals that benefit Swarm's ecosystem as a whole**
- **Community traction: Swarm Association asks projects to showcase community traction**

The more detailed your description, with links and documentation, the better your chances of success. The grant team will evaluate how you plan to leverage Swarm's technologies and how the project is aligned with the [values of the Fair Data Society.](https://fairdatasociety.org/#principles) Projects all over the world are welcome to apply.

 
## **The Application Process**

To apply for a grant, visit the [Grants](https://www.ethswarm.org/grants) website and fill in the application form with the required data. It's important to know that applications are evaluated during **3-month grant wave periods**. The evaluation process might take up to one month.


## **Onboarding Meeting and Formal Agreement**

If your application passes the initial review, your grant will either be immediately approved or you might be invited to an online meeting with the Grants Team. During this meeting, you may be asked to provide additional information about your project, and you'll have the opportunity to ask questions related to the program.

Upon approval, you'll need to sign a formal agreement that outlines concrete milestones that you must achieve, and the corresponding timeline, in order to be eligible for receiving the payment. Setting the milestone and completion data is up to the grantee, so you can adjust according to your schedule and needs. 

## **Getting to Work**
After signing the agreement, you will have a 1 year timeline to complete the project. If you encounter any technical difficulties during this period, don't hesitate to seek assistance and guidance from the  [Swarm Foundation](https://discord.ethswarm.org/) and [Fair Data Society](https://discord.gg/vw3PmWf2rE) Discords.

To receive the grant payout, you must complete the specified milestone and participate in a demo day. The demo day serves as a showcase of your progress and acts as the final step before your funds are sent. \
Make sure that you** submit the results before the 1st of each month**, so evaluation can be prepared before the 10th of the month when payments start.

## **The Grant Amount**

Swarm Grants are limited to 10,000 DAI (paid in BZZ), and if your first grant is successful, you can apply for another grant.

Swarm Association Grants provide an excellent opportunity for projects to integrate Swarm's powerful decentralised storage solutions and contribute to the [Fair Data Protocol's](https://fdp.fairdatasociety.org/) goals of interoperability, self-sovereignty, and privacy. So, if your project aligns with these objectives, head over to the [Grants](https://www.ethswarm.org/grants) website and embark on your journey with Swarm today!
