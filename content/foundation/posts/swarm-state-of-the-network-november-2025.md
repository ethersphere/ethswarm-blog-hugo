### **November 2025 State of the Network Report**

November saw significant changes across several network metrics compared to the previous two months. Total rewards, win values, and average earnings per active node increased, while the number of active staking nodes, winning nodes, and reachable full nodes decreased. This report summarizes the observed values for rewards, participation, and geographic distribution during the month.

{{< admonition info >}}
***Active nodes*** are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

{{< admonition info >}}
All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.
