### **March 2025 State of the Network Report**

March data shows a notable change in network metrics, with total-network rewards increasing significantly compared to February, marking the first such increase in the last several months. This shift occurs alongside a continued decrease in active staking nodes. The combination of increased total rewards and fewer active nodes has resulted in significantly higher per-node rewards this month compared to recent months.

{{< admonition info >}}
"***Active nodes***" are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.

## Conclusion

March data shows a shift in network metrics, with significant increases in rewards and fewer active staking nodes. Total rewards increased by 45.7% while active nodes decreased by 13.1%, resulting in higher earnings per node, which rose by 67.5%.

The total reachable nodes grew by 4.8% while active staking nodes continued to decrease. Both median and average win values increased substantially in March compared to February.

Geographic distribution remains concentrated primarily in China and Finland, with these countries hosting the majority of active nodes.
