### **October 2025 State of the Network Report**


{{< admonition info >}}
***Active nodes*** are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition info >}}
All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.

## Total Active Staking Nodes by Month

This metric shows the total number of active staking nodes, defined as full nodes that have issued at least one commit transaction during the month. This is distinct from the "active node" [count on Swarmscan](https://swarmscan.io/), which includes all "nodes that can connect to and exchange protocol messages."

| Month     | Total Active Staking Nodes |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| May       | 5,277                      |
| June      | 4,934                      |

## Total Reachable Full Nodes Regardless of Active Status

This metric counts the total number of unique full nodes (as determined by unique blockchain address) that were reachable at any point in the month, providing a broader picture of network activity beyond just active committers. This is more in line with the "active node" count [found on Swarmscan](https://swarmscan.io/).

| Month     | Total Reachable Full Nodes |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| May       | 9,371                      |
| June      | 8,473                      |
