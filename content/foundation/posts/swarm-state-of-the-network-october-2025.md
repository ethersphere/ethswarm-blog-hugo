### **October 2025 State of the Network Report**

October brought a month of steady performance across the Swarm network, with rewards, win values, and node participation all saw no significant changes from the previous month. Following September’s network adjustments, metrics for rewards and network participation have all settled into a steady range over the previous two months.

{{< admonition info >}}
***Active nodes*** are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.
