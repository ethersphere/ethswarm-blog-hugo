April saw a decline in xBZZ-denominated rewards, however it must be understood in light of the increase in the [fiat price of xBZZ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-swarm/) over the month. Although rewards in xBZZ decreased, the real-world value distributed to node operators may have remained steady and likely increased for many. 

### **April 2025 State of the Network Report**


{{< admonition info >}}
"***Active nodes***" are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

{{< admonition info >}}
All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.

## Active Staking Node Monthly Average Earnings

This metric shows the average monthly earnings for an active staking node, with an "active node" defined as a node that has submitted at least one commit transaction during the month.
    
| Month     | Avg Total Earnings per Node (xBZZ) |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| November  | 6.90                               |
| December  | 4.69                               |
| January   | 4.10                               |
| February  | 4.19                               |
| March     | 7.02                               |
| **April**   |   **4.88**                    |

![Avg Total Earnings per Node (xBZZ) vs. Month](/uploads/chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node-April-2025.png)

Average earnings per active staking node fell to 4.88 xBZZ in April, down from 7.02 xBZZ in March — a 31.6% decline. However, when considered alongside the nearly 100% increase in the fiat price of BZZ, the actual economic impact may have been neutral or even likely positive for many node operators.

![chart-Unique-txSenders-vs.-Country-April-2025.png](/uploads/chart-Unique-txSenders-vs.-Country-April-2025.png)

The country-level distribution of active staking nodes remains largely unchanged. Finland and China continue to account for the majority of the network, with Germany a distant third. Minor movements in lower-ranked countries had no meaningful effect on the overall landscape.
 
## Conclusion

April saw a broad decline in BZZ-denominated rewards across all metrics, including total rewards, win values, and average earnings per node. However, this trend must be understood in the context of a nearly 100% increase in the fiat price of BZZ, which may have offset or even reversed the apparent drop in value for node operators. There were also some decreases in the number of active and reachable nodes, but the overall global participation has not changed significantly.
