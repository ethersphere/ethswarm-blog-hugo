| October   | 27.70                     |

![chart-Monthly-Median-Win-Values](/uploads/chart-Monthly-Median-Win-Values-October-2024.png)

The median win value in October was 27.70 xBZZ, which represents a slight drop from September’s value of 30.05 xBZZ. 

## Monthly Average Win Values

This metric shows the average win amount for each win event, offering an understanding of how the reward amounts are distributed across the network.

| Month     | Average Win Values (xBZZ)  |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| May       | 36.56                      |
| June      | 37.07                      |

| October   | 28.07                      |

![chart-Monthly-Average-Win-Values](/uploads/chart-Monthly-Average-Win-Values-October-2024.png)

The average win value for October was 28.07 xBZZ, showing a decrease from September’s 32.58 xBZZ. While this is a drop, the value is still higher than the low seen in August, indicating a return to more typical levels after the previous month’s dip.

## Active Staking Node Monthly Average Earnings

This metric shows the average monthly earnings for an active staking node, with an "active node" defined as a node that has submitted at least one commit transaction during the month.

| Month     | Avg Total Earnings per Node (xBZZ) |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| May       | 10.66                              |
| June      | 9.37                               |
| July      | 8.22                               |
| August    | 8.27                               |

| October   | 12.22                              |

![chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node](/uploads/chart-Avg-Total-Earnings-per-Node-October-2024.png)

In October, the average earnings per active staking node were 12.22 xBZZ, a decrease from the sharp rise in September (17.49 xBZZ). This suggests that while earnings per node are still relatively high, they have adjusted to reflect the lower total rewards seen in October.

## Total Active Staking Nodes by Month

This metric shows the total number of active staking nodes, defined as nodes that have issued at least one commit transaction during the month.

| Month     | Total Active Staking Nodes |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| May       | 10,245                     |
| June      | 11,950                     |

October saw a modest increase in active staking nodes, rising to 7,304 from September’s 5,667. 

## Total Reachable Full Nodes Regardless of Active Status

This metric counts the total number of unique full nodes that were reachable at any point in the month, providing a broader picture of network activity beyond just active committers.

| Month     | Total Reachable Full Nodes |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| May       | 16,000                     |

![chart-Total-Reachable-Full-Nodes-Regardless-of-Active-Status](/uploads/chart-Total-Reachable-Full-Nodes-Regardless-of-Active-Status-October-2024.png)


The total number of reachable full nodes decreased in October, dropping to 17,450 from September’s 18,589. This decline continues the trend of fluctuating reachable nodes, likely influenced by the changes in active node participation and network activity.

## Total Winning Nodes by Month

This metric tracks the number of unique staking nodes that won the redistribution game at least once during the month.

| Month     | Total Winning Nodes |
|-----------|---------------------|
| May       | 2,554               |

![chart-Number-of-Winning-Staking-Nodes-by-Month](/uploads/chart-Number-of-Winning-Staking-Nodes-by-Month-October-2024.png)

The total number of winning nodes decreased further in October, falling to 2,108 from September’s 2,379.  

## Total Active Staking Nodes by Country

This section breaks down active staking nodes by country, providing insights into the global distribution of the network.

|               | China  | Germany | Finland | Unknown | United States | Other |
|---------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| May           | 6,010  | 1,739   | 2,173   | 1,899   | 84            | 69    |

![Total Staking Nodes by Country.png](/uploads/Total-Active-Staking-Nodes-by-Country-October-2024.png)

In October, the network saw a small increase in the number of active staking nodes from China, while other countries such as Germany and Finland saw very minor reductions in node counts. The United States continued to be absent from the top ranks, and countries like Spain and the Netherlands experienced increases in their participation, contributing to the "Other" category.

## Conclusion

In October 2024, the Swarm network exhibited both growth and contraction across various metrics. While rewards and average earnings per node showed signs of stability, the decrease in active staking nodes and reachable full nodes highlights the continued fluctuations in network participation. These trends suggest that the Swarm network’s reward distribution and economic mechanisms are functioning as intended, with nodes adjusting to shifting participation levels and rewards.
