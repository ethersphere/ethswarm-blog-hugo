## Bee 2.6.0 Is On the Way: Faster Node Startup and Deeper Insights

Niki Papadatou shared a preview of the upcoming Bee 2.6.0 release, which focuses on improving the user experience for node operators and enhancing network transparency.

Key updates include:
* **Faster Node Onboarding**: Reduced sync and warm-up times for easier setup.
* **Improved Postage Handling**: Optimised postage batch sync during node spin-up.
* **Clearer Documentation**: Streamlined guides and instructions.
* **New Swarm Scan Metrics**: Additional data points to help visualise and understand node behaviour, retrieval efficiency, and responsiveness. \


Niki also introduced a proposed SWIP aimed at improving the pull-sync protocol‚Äìa key part of how data propagates through the network. The team is seeking and would appreciate feedback at this point.


## Simplifying Storage Across Chains with Swarm‚Äôs Multichain App

Callum Toner introduced the beta version of Swarm‚Äôs new Multichain App, a significant leap toward usability and adoption.

With the app, users can:
* Use **any EVM-compatible wallet** and currency
* Automatically **bridge and swap tokens**
* **Buy Swarm storage** (without needing to understand postage stamps or any other mechanics)
* **Upload** files **in just a few clicks** \


This app abstracts the complexity of interacting with Swarm. There‚Äôs no need to run a node, manage depths, or understand storage logic. Just select your storage amount, duration, and pay in your token of choice.

[The beta is live for testing](https://app.ethswarm.org/), and community feedback is highly encouraged!


## EthPrague: Web3 Terminals and Privacy Advocacy 

During the ‚ÄúIn Focus‚Äù section, Ramesh Pallikara shared plans to build a conceptual peer-to-peer Web3 terminal, inspired by classic DOS systems, during the ETHGlobal hackathon in Prague. The goal is to lay the groundwork for a decentralised Web3 operating system that integrates multiple functionalities within one interface.

Following this, PG from[ Web3Privacy Now](https://web3privacy.info/) highlighted their upcoming ETHPrague side event, which will gather voices from the Web3, privacy, and civil society spaces. The event promotes cross-disciplinary dialogue to advance digital rights in the decentralised era. High-profile speakers and a strong ethos of collaboration make this a must-attend for anyone passionate about privacy.

Swarm Foundation team members will be attending both ETHPrague and ETHGlobal ‚Äîconnect with them in person if you‚Äôll be there!


## Swarm Joins Hivello: Expanding into DePIN for Mainstream Reach

Neil Sisson, CMO of[ Hivello](https://hivello.com/), described the platform as a simple consumer app, ‚Äúas easy as Spotify,‚Äù that lets users monetize idle computing resources‚Äìlike AirBnb for your PC. iSwarm is now integrated into Hivello‚Äôs decentralised infrastructure aggregator, joining nine other networks. With over **40,000 nodes and 1M hours of daily uptime**, Hivello helps everyday users monetise their idle computing resources by contributing storage, bandwidth, and more‚Äîno advanced hardware or staking needed.

Swarm‚Äôs inclusion makes it easier than ever for users to contribute to decentralised storage, and it opens the door for wider network growth and awareness.

Thanks to everyone who joined the April call! If you missed it, you can still[ watch the recording here](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1vOxwXQrXzgKB), and we‚Äôll see you again in [May](https://www.addevent.com/event/rb25578762).

Let‚Äôs keep building Swarm together! üêù
