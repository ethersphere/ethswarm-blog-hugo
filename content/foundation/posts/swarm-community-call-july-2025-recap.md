## Swarm Community Call, 31 July – Recap

The July 2025 Swarm Community Call covered key updates in core development, introduced a new initiative connecting Swarm to decentralised AI, and wrapped up with a short community AMA.


## Core Development: Bee 2.6.0 Released & Roadmap for Bee 2.7 

Niki Papadatou shared insights on the successful launch of[ Bee 2.6.0](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2025/bee-2-6-0-release/) on 22 July, which delivered major improvements in node startup times, faster syncing, and overall performance. Node operators are reminded to migrate their stakes due to protocol changes introduced in this update.

Looking ahead, development for Bee 2.7 is already underway, promising further enhancements such as automatic TLS handling for browser-native nodes, new metrics for pull-sync improvements, fixes to erasure coding, improved feed update responsiveness, better transaction fee management, and sampling logic optimisations. Community feedback continues to be instrumental in guiding these developments.


## Swarm MCP: A Bridge to Decentralised AI

András Arányi and Nugaon introduced the Swarm Model Context Protocol (MCP), a new, promising implementation currently in its proof-of-concept stage, which positions Swarm as essential infrastructure for decentralised AI. MCP acts as a universal adapter, enabling AI agents to tap into Swarm’s decentralised storage capabilities seamlessly—offering resilient, private, and persistent memory.

The MCP server handles complexities such as postage stamp management and Swarm API interactions, giving AI agents easy access to core Swarm functionalities like file uploads/downloads, feed usage, and even entire folder structures. Future roadmap plans include expanding agent-to-agent communication options, decentralised agent discovery, private data sharing using Swarm’s Access Control Trie (ACT), and integration with major AI frameworks to foster broader adoption.

Thanks to everyone who joined July's call! If you missed it, you can still[ watch the recording here](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1zqKVjEPByAKB). We’ll see you again on [28 August](https://www.addevent.com/event/Ku26223411).
