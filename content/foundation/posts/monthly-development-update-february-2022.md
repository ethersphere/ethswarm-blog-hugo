There’s no rest for the wicked and February has kept the Swarm team busy as always. A new Bee client release saw the light of day, as have three new releases from the BeeJS team. But the main focus of the entire Swarm team is to realise Milestone 2 of the technical roadmap, [announced last December](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/announcing-the-swarm-foundation-technical-milestones-e66bba8dc6b), in sync with the specified timeline.

After ensuring consistent and persistent storage of files up to 5MB in size, the second milestone will represent a significant move forward. It will provide a much better user experience when setting up a node.

The goal is that every crypto enthusiast with an interest in Swarm can easily set up and use a Bee node. Milestone 2 is directly aimed at simplifying this process so that it can be done in less than 30 minutes. This will be achieved with a desktop app that can be installed without any registration or blockchain interaction.

On the Ecosystem side of things, the team has been fully occupied with organising and delivering the [We Are Millions Hackathon](https://www.wearemillions.online/).
