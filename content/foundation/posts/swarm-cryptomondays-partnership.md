Swarm Foundation is proud to announce a new partnership with **[CryptoMondays](https://www.cryptomondays.io/)**, the world’s largest IRL Web3 community, naming Swarm the **Official Decentralized Storage and Streaming Partner** for CryptoMondays.

This partnership formalizes a long-standing collaboration and signals a shared belief: that the next generation of the internet must be open, permissionless, and owned by its users.


## Building the Future of Web3 Media, Together

Since its beginnings as a New York City meetup in 2018, **CryptoMondays** has grown into a truly global movement — a network of over **150,000 members**, spanning **56 active chapters in 18 countries**. Every Monday, founders, investors, developers, and creators gather in cities around the world to share knowledge, discuss ideas, and strengthen local crypto communities.

More than just meetups, CryptoMondays has evolved into a **multifaceted ecosystem** that includes:



* an **Advisory Service** with over 300 Web3 experts,
* an **AI Web3 Accelerator**,
* a **Token Foundry**, and
* **MonDAI**, its community-building AI agent.


Together, these initiatives embody the same values that drive Swarm: openness, collaboration, and technological sovereignty.


## Decentralized Streaming Meets Decentralized Community

CryptoMondays’ mission is clear — to become the **largest Web3 content streamer**, amplifying community-driven voices across borders. With Swarm as its decentralized infrastructure partner, CryptoMondays gains a censorship-resistant foundation for storing and streaming content — ensuring that talks, panels, and insights shared within their global network remain **accessible, permanent, and free from central control**.


*“We have the opportunity to be the largest streamer of content in Web3, and we’ve partnered with Swarm to help us enable that,” said **Lou Kerner**, founder of CryptoMondays.*

The collaboration represents a powerful alignment of vision: a truly user-run network meeting a truly user-run community. Together, both sides are proving that decentralization is not a theory — it’s a practice.


## Beyond Partnership: Education and Ecosystem Growth

This collaboration goes beyond infrastructure. Together, CryptoMondays and Swarm Foundation will **educate and engage** the broader community about decentralized storage, streaming, and communication through:
* live **webinars and AMAs**, 
* **IRL meetups** hosted across CryptoMondays chapters,
* **X Spaces** and **community discussions**, and
* joint **blog posts** and educational resources.


By merging CryptoMondays’ extensive global reach with Swarm’s experience in decentralized technology, the partnership aims to **expand awareness** and **accelerate adoption** of truly user-owned infrastructure.


*“We’re thrilled that CryptoMondays, Web3’s largest IRL community, has chosen Swarm as its official decentralized storage and streaming partner,” said **Daniel Weber**, Head of Partnerships at Swarm Foundation. “It’s a strong vote of confidence in user-run infrastructure and the power of Web3 on both sides. Together, we’ll make decentralized media easy to share and impossible to silence.”*


## A Shared Vision

At its heart, this partnership celebrates a shared belief: that communities should own their content, creators should keep control of their work, and the digital commons should belong to everyone.

CryptoMondays has been building this reality in person, every week, in cities around the world. Swarm Foundation is proud to help bring that same spirit of freedom and collaboration to the infrastructure layer of Web3.
