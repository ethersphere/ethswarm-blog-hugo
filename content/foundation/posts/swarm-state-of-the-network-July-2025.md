### **July 2025 State of the Network Report**

The July 2025 edition of the State of the Network report provides an overview of key activity and performance metrics across the Swarm network. These figures offer insight into node participation, reward distribution, and geographic trends during the month.

{{< admonition info >}}
"***Active nodes***" are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.

Finland and China remained the top two countries by active node count, with Finland further widening its lead in July.


## Conclusion

July 2025 marked a mixed month for the Swarm network. While total rewards, average payouts, and median win values all saw significant increases, the number of active staking nodes and winning nodes declined. This suggests that rewards were concentrated among fewer participants, leading to higher individual payouts. The overall network reach improved, as evidenced by the increase in total reachable full nodes. Geographically, node distribution remained heavily centered in Finland and China, continuing the trend observed in previous months.
