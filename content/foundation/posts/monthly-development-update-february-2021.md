February has been a remarkable month for the Swarm and the [Fair Data Society](https://fairdatasociety.org/) team. Apart from the regular work on the Swarm code, which produced a new release of [Swarm (v0.5.1)](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/releases/tag/v0.5.2), the two teams joined forces and managed to pull off a really interesting [hackathon](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/liberate-data-week-hackathon-recap-4fc9899bd30d) event.

The seven-day hackathon was full of valuable announcements, demos, and talks. [Five of the competing teams made it to the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7qK5Kl1a8&list=PL6fQnFAjtuY-VdZ_5TNemX2gYc7eMfqhu&index=3) and produced their own thin dApp on Swarm, each earning them the event’s first prize (5000 BZZZ tokens).

A [**1 million BZZ token airdrop**](https://bit.ly/2Ov1bdG) was announced, and almost five thousand new Bee nodes were installed.

Without further ado, dive into the detailed report of the team’s work below.
