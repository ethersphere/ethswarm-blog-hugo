## Turning Toward the Next Phase

[The Solstice edition of the Swarm Community Call](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ZkJzZdLAAdJv) offered a thorough overview of the past half year, and if there was a single meta-theme, it was this: Swarm is trying to make decentralization feel less like a ceremony and more like a default. Less “trust me,” more “here’s the tool—try it, break it, tell us where it hurts.” That’s not flashy, but it’s how infrastructure becomes real.

The host of the event, Migle, opened with the wider context: web3 is slowly re-learning its original lesson—that privacy and permissionless access aren’t vibes, they’re infrastructure. Swarm’s thesis remains the same: decentralized storage and communication that doesn’t quietly smuggle in central control. The catch, as always, is that decentralization in practice tends to be harder, slower, and occasionally rough around the edges.


### **A frank checkpoint from the Foundation**

Sandor A. Nagy, COO at Swarm Foundation, set the tone with an honest update: Swarm hasn’t yet delivered the “success story” many early supporters hoped for—adoption, token performance, and narrative dominance included. That acknowledgement wasn’t framed as defeat, but as a constraint: the only way out is through fundamentals. Over the past six months, the teams focused on stability, usability, developer experience, and real-world integrations—especially streaming and decentralized AI readiness—without promising overnight miracles.


### **Core network progress: fewer sharp corners**

Product owner Niki Papadatou walked us through a year of client maturation. The headline improvement was operational: node spin-up time dropped from roughly 40 minutes to under five, with smoother warm-up/syncing and improved reliability across the stack. A set of major upgrades is queued for early 2026 (including Auto-TLS and multiple underlay support), and the underlying theme stayed consistent: make Swarm predictable for node operators and buildable for developers.

Two community-led in-browser node efforts were highlighted as a key signal: client diversity is no longer theoretical. The Foundation’s role here is less “hero builder” and more “protocol enabler”—ensuring that network upgrades land in a way that allows community clients to thrive.


### **UX as strategy: less crypto aerobics**

Áron delivered the blunt truth (“Web3 UX is bad”) and then showed the fix: [Beeport](https://beeport.ethswarm.org/) and multichain funding. Beeport lets users upload to Swarm without running a node, purchase storage via multichain payments, and connect content to ENS—without the usual rituals of bridging and swapping. Multichain funding applies the same idea to node setup: one link, one transaction, and the node receives the required funds under the hood. The point wasn’t just convenience; it was removing the “I’ll do this later” trap that quietly kills adoption.


### **Desktop App: making Swarm feel livable**

Nidish (Solar Punk) presented the [Desktop App](https://www.ethswarm.org/build/desktop)’s evolution toward an everyday, lightweight client. The new [file manager](https://solarpunk.buzz/swarm-file-manager-cloud-like-web3-storage/) flows aim to make Swarm understandable through familiar concepts—drives, versions, retention, and “trash”—while Swarm remains Swarm underneath (chunks, stamps, immutability). The deeper bet here is as much psychological as technical: participation grows when the system feels safe, repeatable, and familiar.


### **Identity: from “your node is you” to “you are you”**

András introduced a proof-of-concept identity model designed to decouple identity from infrastructure. The proposed hierarchy—Master identity → Personas → Session keys—targets the missing ingredient for a real content economy: portable identity that works across devices and gateways. The practical payoff is big: subscriptions, token-gating, private interactions, and creator monetisation that attach to people, not to whichever machine happens to be running a node at the time.


### **Streaming: Web2 features, Web3 guarantees**

András returned with the [Multimedia Streaming Restricted Solution](https://solarpunk.buzz/msrs-decentralized-streaming-swarm/) (MSRS), now positioned as a B2B-ready stack rather than a demo. The key claim is ambitious: fully decentralized live + VOD streaming with chat and social features, without cloud dependencies. Daniel Weber, BizDev Lead, then grounded this in real adoption: MSRS already underpins the collaboration with [CryptoMondays](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2025/cryptomondays-partnership/), aimed at building a censorship-resistant Web3 multimedia library. The direction is clear: experiences on par with Web2, but with user sovereignty intact.


### **AI readiness: agents need memory that can’t be unplugged**

Andrei introduced [Swarm MCP](https://solarpunk.buzz/mcp-revolution-decentralized-ai-swarm/) (Model Context Protocol) as the “universal adapter” that lets AI frameworks treat Swarm as durable memory. The newly released Hashgraph plugin demonstrates three autonomous capabilities: agents can buy storage, write immutable logs and artifacts, and maintain mutable identity or state via Swarm Feeds. Daniel connected this to the “agentic economy” thesis: the future is specialized agents coordinating with one another, which requires discovery, secure communication, and persistent context. Swarm’s ambition is to be the data layer that doesn’t collapse into a single cloud account.


### **DeSci and health data: the hard part isn’t only technical**

[TalTech](https://taltech.ee/en) professor and researcher Toomas Klementi brought a valuable outside perspective: decentralized health data systems require scalability and sustainability—but the largest obstacle may be social inertia and regulation, not code. His “paper shredder” metaphor—store the pieces, keep the key—made Swarm’s content-addressed model legible to non-technical audiences. His feedback also reinforced the evening’s UX theme: if running a node becomes point-and-click, and funding becomes frictionless, adoption beyond existing circles becomes plausible.


### **Provenance + IPFS bridge: trust and onboarding**

Črt Ahlin ([Datafund](https://datafund.io/)) shared a [provenance toolkit](https://provenance.datafund.io/)—gateway + CLI + MCP server—that enables both humans and agents to attach verifiable provenance metadata to data stored on Swarm, effectively creating an audit trail for the AI economy. Henry Bergström ([Metaprovide](https://metaprovide.org/)) and Ramesh Pallikara then introduced IPSH, a bridge that exposes IPFS-compatible endpoints while persisting data on Swarm. Positioned as a practical alternative to centralized pinning services, the message was clear: meet IPFS developers where they already are, and offer real persistence guarantees.


### **Tokenomics: change is coming, but not rushed**

Callum Toner and Ramesh closed on the probably most sensitive topic of the evening: tokenomics. The message was candid—the current state lacks clarity and alignment, and 2026 will bring meaningful iteration. Near-term steps include enabling staking withdrawals and improving incentives, alongside continued research into market design and oracle robustness. Importantly, these changes were framed as a community-led process shaped through SWIPs and Discord, not a black-box decree.


### **Viktor’s through-line: adoption via ecosystem products**

Viktor Trón, Swarm Foundation’s founder and director, tied the evening together with a unifying goal: adoption driven by real products, built across a healthy ecosystem rather than solely within the Foundation. He also pointed to ongoing work on technology, organization, and tokenomics, shaped in close dialogue with the community.
