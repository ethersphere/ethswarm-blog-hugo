#### *Key Themes and Quarterly Priorities*

The strategic direction for 2026 is structured around five key themes that define where Swarm will concentrate research, core development, and ecosystem efforts over the year. These themes reflect the primary areas in which focused progress is expected to have the greatest impact across the network. 

Together, they support three shared outcomes for the Swarm ecosystem: improved usability, broader adoption, and easier integration—and in doing so, strengthen the value proposition for all stakeholders, from developers and partners to end users. The sections below outline each theme and the intended outcomes associated with it.


### Ease of Use & Accessibility 

Lowering entry barriers to essential Swarm functionality, particularly for developers building on the network, is a primary objective. This theme focuses on easier node installation, improved data management and sharing workflows, support for blockchain-agnostic payment solutions, and device- and chain-agnostic access.

While expanding accessibility and encouraging wider adoption, the foundational properties of the network remain critical. Continuous improvements to performance, reliability, and resilience therefore remain a priority alongside usability enhancements.  


### Multimedia Streaming & Social

Swarm is ready to enable multimedia and social applications that require interactive streaming capabilities, including live broadcasts and real-time communication. This theme positions Swarm as infrastructure capable of supporting persistent content delivery at scale, while maintaining the resilience properties expected of decentralized systems. 

Addressing identity and access management is central to enabling creator-focused use cases such as direct monetization, exclusive gated content, and private communication. 



### Blockchain & Data Availability

Providing a reliable storage layer for L1 and L2 networks remains a core focus area. This includes storing transaction history, state data, blobs, and NFTs, as well as hosting dApp frontends.  

The objective is to ensure long-term data availability while supporting granular access control, meeting both protocol-level and application-level requirements.



### AI and DeSci

Swarm addresses centralization and privacy risks in AI by providing a censorship-resistant infrastructure that supports data sovereignty, verifiable provenance, and secure storage. 

This theme enables a trustless environment for autonomous agents and data-driven collaboration, with standardized access mechanisms and granular data-sharing solutions. Over time, Swarm can support a sustainable Agent-to-Agent (A2A) economy in which AI services can be discovered, coordinated, and monetized without reliance on centralized intermediaries.



### Supply Chain

Swarm's unique Access Control Trie (ACT) enables fine-grained permission management for supply chain use cases. This allows stakeholders to securely share sensitive information, such as shipment manifests or provenance records, with selected partners. 

By allowing access rights to be granted or revoked dynamically at the chunk level, complex multi-party supply chains can maintain data privacy and integrity without dependence on a central authority.


### Quarterly Strategic Focus Points (2026)

Throughout 2026, the Core Development Team will continue working in close coordination with developer teams across the Swarm ecosystem. This collaboration will be structured to address technical dependencies layer by layer, supporting steady progress across the defined key themes.



* Q1 – Stability
* Q2 – Identity Management
* Q3 – Device- and Chain-Agnostic Access 
* Q4 – Advanced MCP support
