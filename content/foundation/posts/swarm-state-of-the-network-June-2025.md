### **June 2025 State of the Network Report**

The June 2025 edition of the State of the Network report presents an overview of key activity and performance metrics across the Swarm network. These figures provide insight into node participation, reward distribution, and geographic activity throughout the month. 


{{< admonition info >}}
"***Active nodes***" are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

{{< admonition info >}}
All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.

## Conclusion

June 2025 saw a slight decrease in overall network activity, with a reduction in total reachable nodes and total rewards distributed compared to the previous month. However, key participation metrics—including the number of winning nodes and active committers—remained relatively stable. The geographic distribution of active nodes continues to be concentrated in a few key regions, notably China and Finland.
