Only one month after we announced the 1 million BZZ tokens airdrop, the Swarm network has grown immensely. To take part in this airdrop, participants have to install and run their Bee nodes. We have received a lot of feedback from the community and the network is getting more decentralized and resilient in the testing phase than we ever thought it could be. As of today, there are more than 23,600 Bee nodes running all over the world.

**If you haven’t done so already, join us! Install your Bee node.**

We have been releasing tutorials on [how to install your Bee node](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/how-to-run-a-bee-node-and-earn-gbzz-7f336314b47b) in various ways, and now it’s time to take a deeper look and show you how you can cash out your gBZZ cheques.

The development team has been focusing on main features and bug fixes until now. We are aware that using the terminal and some basic scripts to do the cashout process is still demanding from users, so we are working to improve the UX of this process. Soon we will release a decent dashboard with built-in functions for the basic node operations. With it, the less-technical people will also be able to run and maintain their nodes with ease.

**Important notice regarding cashing out cheques**

Please bear in mind that the amount of real BZZ tokens from the airdrop is not determined by the number of cashed-out cheques but by the value of the cheques your node(s) generated. The best practice is to cash out cheques only every now and then. Otherwise, we are putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on the Goerli testnet. You only need to cash out all your cheques just before we switch to the mainnet.

Without further ado, let’s dive into the [how-to cash out gBzz cheques tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x5mCLJZnoA). As usual, we have created a simple video that you can follow.
