### **August 2025 State of the Network Report**

August brought another month of strong performance for the Swarm network. Total rewards climbed to the highest level seen this year, and both median and average win values continued to rise, further improving payouts for node operators. Active node counts rebounded slightly from July’s sharp decline, though overall network reach dipped as fewer full nodes were online. The most striking change was geographical: China overtook Finland to become the leading hub of active nodes, signaling a significant shift in the network’s distribution.

{{< admonition info >}}
"***Active nodes***" are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.

## Total Active Staking Nodes by Country

This metric shows the total number of active staking nodes globally for the month of August, 2025.

| Country       | Unique txSenders |
|---------------|------------------|
| China         | 1,941            |
| Finland       | 1,668            |
| Unknown       | 33               |
| Hungary       | 9                |
| United States | 4                |

| Russia        | 1                |
| Lithuania     | 1                |
| Norway        | 1                |

Between July and August 2025, active nodes in China more than doubled (932 → 1,941) while Finland's active node count dropped sharply (2,239 → 1,668). Many smaller contributor countries from July (Germany, UK, Romania, etc.) disappeared, while August saw a concentration in just a few regions, with China and Finland dominating most of the activity.


## Conclusion

In summary, August 2025 set a new high for rewards this year, with both median and average win values strengthening payouts. Active node participation recovered slightly, though overall network reach contracted. The geographic landscape shifted dramatically, China overtook Finland as the largest hub of active staking nodes, while other smaller countries dropped off the list.
