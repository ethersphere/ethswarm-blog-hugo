### **May 2025 State of the Network Report**

May saw a modest rebound in xBZZ-denominated rewards and node participation compared to April. Although some metrics remained below their earlier peaks, the network demonstrated signs of stabilization. 

{{< admonition info >}}
"***Active nodes***" are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

{{< admonition info >}}
All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.

![chart-Unique-txSenders-vs.-Country-May-2025.png](/uploads/chart-Unique-txSenders-vs.-Country-May-2025.png)

The country-level distribution of active staking nodes in May remained stable, with China and Finland continuing to represent the largest share of the network.

## Conclusion

May saw a moderate rebound in key network metrics, including total rewards, win values, average earnings per node, and active staking nodes. However, some metrics—such as reachable full nodes and total winning nodes—continued to decline. Overall, the network showed signs of resilience despite earlier declines, with continued participation across most major regions.
