The June 2025 [Swarm Community Call](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1vAxRDNzWQZGl) provided important updates from core development, community discussions on tokenomics, and showcased performance and UX innovations. 

Here are the key takeaways from the session:


## Core Development: Updates for Bee 2.6.0

Callum Toner and Ljubiša Gačević discussed the postponed Bee 2.6.0 release, emphasising security and thorough testing to ensure network integrity. Key improvements in the upcoming version include significantly faster node spin-up times, refined transaction cost estimates, and a revamped testing environment with dedicated smart contracts and isolated mainnet clusters to simulate future migrations. Upcoming priorities include improvements to the testing framework, updates to the handshake protocol, and exploration of shared TCP listeners for WebSockets.

Callum also highlighted the multichain application, which is designed to simplify interaction with Swarm across different blockchain ecosystems. The app is now available for public testing at [app.ethswarm.org](app.ethswarm.org). Further features are planned following the launch, including ENS integrations and additional multichain support.


## Swarmonomics Research Initiative

Andrew and Aata from Shtuka Research introduced [Swarmonomics](https://blog.ethswarm.org/foundation/2025/shtuka-partnership/)—a year-long research programme aimed at improving the economics of the BZZ token. The initiative will study market dynamics, price responsiveness, liquidity, and the mechanisms of supply and demand within the Swarm network. Monthly updates and research results will be [shared on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/799027393297514537/1068161013934985287) and complemented by public dashboards and reports.


## Performance and UX Innovations from Etherna

[Etherna](http://etherna.io)'s Mirko Da Corte presented major performance improvements to the Swarm client through the .NET-based [Bee.net library](https://github.com/Etherna/bee-net), which delivers over threefold speed improvements when hashing large files. Etherna also introduced [Beehive](https://github.com/Etherna/beehive): a new scalable meta-node with advanced APIs for bulk data uploads, enhanced pinning capabilities, and new security measures to improve privacy and content protection.

The next Community Call will be held on [31 July](https://www.addevent.com/event/vZ25996868) - see you then!
