_(23 to 27 August 2021; online event)_

The Swarm Association is organising a series of lectures and workshops called the Swarm Summer School. Sign up and don’t miss your chance to learn directly from the team.

* **When:** 23 to 27 August 2021 (15:00–18:00 CET)
* **Where:** this is an online event
* **How to sign up:** [**https://bit.ly/37JPEOa**](https://bit.ly/37JPEOa "https://bit.ly/37JPEOa")

## **Swarm’s ecosystem is growing**

This event is the next step in Swarm’s efforts to grow the ecosystem of projects building the fair data economy on Swarm. The goal of the school is to provide additional knowledge to people who already have a project idea, or to anyone who just wants to learn more about Swarm.

This online event will take place over five days from **23 to 27 August** with daily sessions from **15.00–18.00 CET** (GMT+2).

## **Present your idea to the Swarm team**

The school will consist of lectures and workshops focusing on the business, legal, technology, and social aspects of developing your project or idea. No prior technical knowledge is needed.

Teams will be able to present their projects to guest speakers and the Swarm team in order to evaluate their idea from different perspectives. If you are interested in making a presentation, please [contact us here](https://swarm.odoo.com/survey/start/7d956538-3043-4640-95ce-5100e9ac3900).

## **Promoting privacy and the fair data economy**

Attendance is highly recommended, especially for anyone developing solutions to enable digital freedom and working towards a fair data society.

## **Collaborate with other projects and make new connections**

Swarm will dedicate a special channel on Discord, where teams can meet and discuss their ideas, ask questions and create new social connections for possible collaboration on their projects.

[**Don’t forget to sign up, and we’ll see you at the Swarm Summer School**](https://swarm.odoo.com/survey/start/7d956538-3043-4640-95ce-5100e9ac3900)**.**
