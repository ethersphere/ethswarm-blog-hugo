### **December 2025 State of the Network Report**

This report provides an overview of the Swarm network’s key metrics for December 2025, including rewards, participation levels, and node distribution, and places them in context with recent monthly trends.

{{< admonition info >}}
***Active nodes*** are full nodes identified by a unique Gnosis Chain address with the required minimum staked xBZZ that have submitted a [commit](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/concepts/incentives/redistribution-game/#redistribution-game-details) transaction during the month.

{{< admonition info >}}
All rewards are denominated in xBZZ. Since the fiat value of xBZZ fluctuates monthly, these metrics may not reflect the real-world returns for node operators.

## Conclusion

December 2025 reflects a period of partial stabilization following November’s more pronounced shifts. While rewards and win values decreased slightly, they remain elevated compared to earlier months. Participation metrics show mixed signals: active and winning node counts recovered modestly, but the total number of reachable full nodes continued to decline.
