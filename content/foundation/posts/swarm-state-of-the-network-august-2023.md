This report provides an in-depth overview of the state of storage incentives on the Ethswarm network for the month of August. Detailed below are insights into monthly rewards in BZZ tokens, single node monthly earnings, median win values, average win values, monthly unique staking nodes, and the geographic distribution of nodes. This data serves as a valuable indicator of the ongoing growth trends within the Swarm network. 


### Data limitations: 

* All data is based on nodes which have won the redistribution game at least once per month. While the average number of win events in every month for running a single staking node is greater than one, it is still possible to operate a node for a month without a win event occurring.
* The data from March is incomplete as it began being collected from March 12th.

### Network Total Monthly Rewards

This metric is the total monthly rewards paid out across the entire network.

| Month  | Total Rewards (BZZ)  |

| April  | 20503    |
| May    | 21423   |
| June   | 26655     |
| July   | 34839    |
| August | 135927     |

The median win values have gradually increased, with a noticeable jump in August, indicating a positive trend in node incentives.

### Monthly Average Win Values

This metric is the average win amount for each win event.

| Month  | Average Win Value |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| March  | 6.78               |
| April  | 7.60               |

Consistent with the median values, the average win values have seen a steady increase.

### Number of Staking Nodes by Month

This is determined by the number of unique staking nodes each month which have won at least once in that month (as noted above, it does not include nodes which did not win in that month).

| Month  | Number of Nodes |
| ------ | --------------- |
| March  | 1011            |
| April  | 1434            |
| May    | 1443            |

The data indicates a steady growth in the number of staking nodes, emphasizing the increasing interest in the Swarm network.

### Total Active Nodes by Month

This metric is defined as the total number of unique nodes (both staking and non-staking nodes) which are active on the Swarm network each month.

| Month  | Number of Nodes |
| ------ | --------------- |
| March  | 3470            |
| April  | 2016            |
