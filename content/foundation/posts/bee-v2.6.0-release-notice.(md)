# 🚀 Bee v2.6.0 Is Now Live!

{{< admonition warning >}}
⚠️ **Immediate Action Required for Node Operators**
**Bee v2.6.0 introduces changes that require a stake migration.**
To remain compatible with the network, you **must upgrade your node and migrate your stake**.
🔗 [Follow the migration guide →](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/bee/working-with-bee/staking/#stake-migration)
{{< /admonition >}}

We’re excited to announce that **Bee v2.6.0** has officially been released!

This update brings **faster node startup**, **new performance metrics**, and a series of **bug fixes and improvements**.



## ⚡ Faster Startup

Bee nodes now import postage batch data from a **snapshot file** by default, skipping the need to sync historical postage events. This results in significantly **faster startup times** for newly started nodes. 


{{< admonition information >}}
The snapshot will NOT be used for a node which was previously shut down and then restarted.
{{< /admonition >}}

Additionally, protocol readiness is now determined dynamically based on **peer availability**, eliminating the need for a fixed startup delay.


## 📊 Upload & Download Metrics

This release adds new metrics for tracking **upload and download speeds** between your node and its peers. These metrics are part of the status protocol and provide the Bee dev team with valuable insights that will help to further improve performance.


## 🐞 Bug Fixes & Maintenance

This release fixes several node performance related bugs, cleans up deprecated options, and improves error reporting. It also includes updates to Go and go-ethereum versions, smart contracts, and API docs.
