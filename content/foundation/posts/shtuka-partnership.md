We're excited to announce that Shtuka Research will be partnering with Swarm Foundation as an external research contributor to map out the Swarm Network's economic landscape, optimise protocol parameters, and conduct fundamental research into new financial primitives.

With origins that trace back to the very beginning of Ethereum, the Swarm Protocol is a permissionless storage pool protocol in which users can buy storage quotas over a pool of thousands of nodes, by sending tokens to a smart contract, at prices comparable to traditional cloud storage. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only decentralised storage platform with these characteristics.

This new partnership comes at a time when the Swarm Community is shifting priorities from research to onboarding real users, and the core team and Swarm Foundation are pushing towards greater transparency and focus. More than ever, Swarm needs a robust node population ready to meet the new demand brought by these users.

We'll be working with the Swarm Foundation research team to answer market structure and econometric questions like:

- How competitive is the Swarm node market?
- Is the Swarm storage market liquid enough to respond to demand spikes?
- Is the price quoting mechanism responsive enough to signal that more supply is needed in a timely manner?
- Are BZZ or storage price fluctuations scaring off potential users?
- Will prices converge to stable equilibrium, or diverge or oscillate wildly?
- What can devs do to further stablise the pricing UX?

Using a combination of econometric studies, control theory, and financial engineering, Shtuka Research will help the Swarm research community ensure that node supply is able to elastically scale to demand, prices strike a balance between stability and competitiveness, and infrastructure operators have access to the information they need to make sound investment decisions.
