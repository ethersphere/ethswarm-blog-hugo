Swarm Foundation is excited to announce that [Shtuka Research](https://shtuka.io/) is partnering with the organisation as an external research contributor to map out the economic landscape of the Swarm Network, optimise protocol parameters, and conduct foundational research into new financial primitives.

With origins tracing back to the early days of Ethereum, the Swarm Protocol is a permissionless storage pool protocol in which users can acquire storage quotas across a pool of thousands of nodes by sending tokens to a smart contract, at prices comparable to those of traditional cloud storage. To the best of Swarm Foundation's knowledge, it is the only decentralised storage platform with these specific characteristics.

This new partnership comes at a time when the Swarm Community is shifting focus from research to onboarding real users. Concurrently, both the core team and Swarm Foundation are undergoing a transformation towards a more transparent operating model. Now more than ever, the Swarm Network needs a robust and responsive node population capable of meeting the increased demand from new users.

Shtuka Research will work with Swarm Foundation's research team to explore key questions related to market structure and econometric questions, such as:

- How competitive is the Swarm node market?
- Is the Swarm storage market sufficiently liquid to respond to demand spikes?
- Is the price quoting mechanism responsive enough to signal supply needs in a timely fashion?
- Are BZZ or storage price fluctuations creating friction for potential users?
- Will prices converge towards a stable equilibrium, or diverge or oscillate?
- What refinements can developers make to improve the pricing experience and user expectations?

Using a combination of econometric studies, control theory, and financial engineering, Shtuka Research aims to support the Swarm research community in ensuring that node supply can elastically meet demand, that pricing remains both competitive and predictable, and that infrastructure operators have access to the insights they need to make informed decisions.
